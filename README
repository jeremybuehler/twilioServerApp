This is a sample app to mock an IVR call with a fictitious company called Trade Shipping Company.

INSTRUCTIONS
************
The app needs to have some stuff configured before you can start it. First of all you need a demo twilio account. You can 
signup for free on wwww.twilio.com and get one. On your dashboard, you will find your application_sid and auth_token. Replace the 
sid and token with these values in app.js. 

You will also get a verified number that can make calls to you and a number that you can call to. You configure it on the dashboard when you signup.
Replace VERIFIED_NUMBER_CALL_FROM and VERIFIED_NUMBER_CALL_TO with these values. In addition you need to set the appurl. This is where your server
will be running. You can't use localhost directly. You must tunnel and expose it to the internet. Or you can use an external server for it. 
So a sample appurl will be : http://www.yourserver.com:3000/ivr/step1

Start the app with command : $>node app.js
Navigate to http://www.yourserver.com:3000/, and you will find a nice welcome screen that instructs you to enter the number you want to call to. 

If you have a premium account you can call any number. With a demo account you can just use the one you configured.

Hit the call button and an IVR call will be made to the number you specified. 

Have fun !!
